## Naming convention
Depending on the type of variable, it is as follows:
PublicVariable
_privateVariable
localVariable

## Project Structure
I tried to keep everything in corresponding folders, although I might adjust "what goes into where" from time to time.
I mainly try to keep "Graphics" seperated from "Scripts" and separated from "Unity Objects"

### Graphics
Graphics include Textures, Materials, Animations and 3D models

## What I would improve
1. Lighting. Personally, I didn't like the outcome with the lighting, I would improve the fog and the material settigns for the objects in the game.
2. Line Renderer. I also would add a curve to the path, either by adding more points, or by making a *Bezier Curve* shader/script.
3. AI. I would dedicate a lot more time to improve AI. make more different styles of AI, some more passive and some more agressive.
4. Animations. I would spend a bit more in creating better animations for the flips. Right now it feels too repetitive and having more flips would definetily make it more fun.

## What I am proud of
1. Level Generation. I made a seed-based level generation, so it is random, but you can remember which seeds gave you a level you liked and save that seed so you can always play the best levels.
2. App Size.
3. Code. Overall, I think my code is pretty clean and easy to read.
4. Performance. I tried the game in a device from 2015 and it runs pretty well.

## What I would add
1. Multiplayer. I would love to use PHOTON Engine to add Multiplayer functionality.
2. Avatars. Who doesn't love to buy clothes and accessories for your character.
3. More obstacles. I think this game has the potential to include more obstacles and other types of tracks.
